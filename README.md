# Rails Nested Comments Using closure_tree gem

## Description

Test application I used to work out how to implement nested comments for a Rails app. Very bare-bones blog style app, where a User (devise) has Articles, Articles have comments and each comment can have replies.

This app makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/mceachen/closure_tree">closure_tree gem</a>, which gives data a tree structure.

## Future

Will be adding testing.
